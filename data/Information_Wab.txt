Western Academy of Beijing (WAB) – Comprehensive Overview (June 2025)

Western Academy of Beijing (WAB) is a leading non-profit international school in Beijing, China. Founded in 1994, WAB serves Nursery/Pre-K to Grade 12 with about 1,400 students from a diverse range of countries  . No single nationality exceeds 20% of the student body, reflecting WAB’s truly international character . The school is independent and non-sectarian, governed by an all-volunteer Board of Trustees and led by Head of School Dr. Marta Medved Krajnovic . WAB prides itself on innovative, high-quality education delivered by a highly qualified faculty (student–teacher ratio ~7:1) . Below is a detailed look at WAB’s programs, community, and recent developments as of mid-2025.

Academic Programs and Curriculum

IB Curriculum: WAB is an IB World School offering the full continuum of International Baccalaureate programs. In the Elementary (Early Years to Grade 5) WAB uses the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) . The Middle School (Grades 6–10) follows the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP), and High School students in Grades 11–12 undertake the IB Diploma Programme (DP) . In addition to the IB DP, WAB’s High School also offers an American-accredited WAB High School Diploma to all graduates . The curriculum is taught in English, with robust support for other languages and individualized learning needs.

Curriculum Highlights: WAB emphasizes inquiry-based, transdisciplinary learning. In the PYP, for example, students explore six Units of Inquiry integrating multiple disciplines under real-world themes . Literacy and Mathematics programs draw on international standards (e.g. Australia’s ACARA), focusing on conceptual understanding and real-life application . Across all divisions, students are encouraged to develop the IB Learner Profile attributes – to be open-minded, principled, knowledgeable, reflective thinkers and communicators . By high school, WAB expects students to take increasing ownership of their learning, managing time and reflecting on feedback .

Course Offerings: WAB provides a broad range of courses and electives, leveraging the flexibility of the IB framework. High School students choose from a wide selection of IB DP subjects across groups (Studies in Language and Literature, Language Acquisition, Individuals & Societies, Sciences, Mathematics, and The Arts). For example, WAB offers multiple world languages: Chinese is taught from early years through Grade 12 (with tracks for native and non-native speakers)  ; in secondary school French and Spanish are offered as additional language options , and the Swiss School program (see Partnerships below) enables German mother-tongue instruction. WAB’s IB Diploma candidates often pursue bilingual diplomas – in 2024, 21 students earned the IB Bilingual Diploma in languages including Chinese, German, Korean, Japanese, and Danish , underscoring the school’s multicultural ethos.

Innovative Learning Initiatives: As a five-time “Most Innovative International School in China” award winner (2019–2025) , WAB has pioneered several unique academic initiatives:
	•	“Day 9” – an innovation in scheduling that empowers high schoolers to design a personalized learning day to delve into passions or interdisciplinary projects  . This promotes student agency and depth of inquiry beyond the standard curriculum.
	•	Capstone & Experiential Programs – Middle School and High School students engage in capstone projects, interdisciplinary challenges, and service learning that connect classroom learning to real-world problems . WAB’s Global Citizenship Program integrates academics with community partnerships, encouraging students to apply knowledge to global and local challenges .
	•	STEM and Design – WAB provides cutting-edge design technology, robotics labs, and maker spaces, giving students hands-on experience with engineering design cycles and problem-solving. Students regularly participate in STEM showcases and competitions; for instance, Grade 8s used coding and geometry to build maze-solving robots in a recent “Maze Runner” challenge . These experiences prepare students for an era of AI and emerging technologies  .
	•	Outdoor Education (“WAB Wild”) – WAB integrates outdoor and environmental education. Starting in the Elementary years and through secondary, students take part in WAB Wild expeditions and camp experiences that build survival skills, teamwork, and appreciation for nature . This ensures holistic development beyond academics.

All students are supported by a robust Student Support Services department, including counseling, learning support, English as an Additional Language (EAL), and psychological services  . WAB’s inclusive philosophy means it admits a range of learners; faculty differentiate instruction and provide enrichment or support so that each student can achieve personal excellence .

Academic Outcomes: WAB’s IB results reflect its high standards. The Class of 2024 achieved an average IB Diploma score of 33 points, nearly 3 points above the world average (with a 5.28 average subject grade) . Notably, WAB does not restrict access to the full DP – all students are encouraged to take on the IB’s rigor – making these above-average results even more significant . The school emphasizes that success is measured not only in exam scores but in developing well-rounded, resilient learners. (Indeed, the Class of 2024 navigated pandemic disruptions and still excelled, with over half the cohort earning top grades in core areas like Theory of Knowledge)  .

Co-Curricular Programs: Arts, Athletics, Activities

Philosophy: WAB’s co-curricular program is branded “WABX”, encompassing all student activities beyond the classroom . WABX offers an extensive array of clubs, arts, sports, and service opportunities to enrich students’ growth. In a typical year, WABX coordinates 300+ clubs, cultural and service activities, and over 100 athletic teams/options across the school . Participation is encouraged from the youngest grades through high school, with a focus on both breadth (trying new pursuits) and depth (developing passions).

Visual & Performing Arts: The Arts are a cornerstone of WAB life, with thriving programs in music, drama, dance, visual arts, and film:
	•	Music: Students can join choirs and numerous instrumental ensembles across age groups. WAB’s instrumental music program spans String Orchestra, Beginner/Intermediate Bands, Concert Band, Jazz Band, and student-formed rock bands . Young musicians perform in school concerts, assemblies, and signature events like Rock in the Park. WAB musicians also audition for prestigious inter-school festivals – for example, WAB regularly participates in the Asia Pacific Activities Conference (APAC) Music festival and the International Schools Choral Music Society (ISCMS) Honor Choir/Orchestra, showcasing talent alongside peers from across Asia .
	•	Drama & Dance: Each school division produces an annual theatrical production (plays or musicals), involving students not just as actors but also in backstage roles (set design, lighting, sound) . In Middle and High School, students may also join after-school drama clubs and dance troupes to refine their skills and perform. WAB is an APAC Arts school, sending delegations to APAC Drama and APAC Dance festivals where students collaborate with international peers  . These experiences build confidence, creativity, and teamwork.
	•	Visual Arts: Budding artists have many outlets. In addition to art classes integrated into the curriculum, WABX offers after-school visual arts clubs where students experiment with mediums and showcase their work. Student art is displayed around campus and in dedicated exhibitions. High School hosts the WAB Identity Film Festival, highlighting student-produced films and media, and the Tiger Sports & Entertainment Network (TSEN) club involves students in video production and live broadcasting of school events . Visual arts students also contribute to school publications and year-round gallery displays .

This rich arts environment was recognized in 2025 when WAB won the national China Schools Award for Arts & Creativity, a distinction by the British Chamber of Commerce in China honoring the school’s outstanding commitment to fostering creativity .

Sports and Athletics: WAB’s sports program is both inclusive and competitive. Students from Junior Grade 1 (Kindergarten) up to Grade 12 can join age-appropriate teams and clubs in 16 different competitive sports  . The sports offered include athletics such as rugby, football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, badminton, tennis, table tennis, swimming, baseball/softball, cross-country, track & field, among others . There are typically three to four sports seasons per year, allowing students to try multiple sports or focus on one at junior varsity and varsity levels . Notably, WAB’s Tigersharks swim team runs year-round for committed swimmers  .

WAB teams compete in a robust interscholastic circuit. The school is a member of several regional athletic conferences, including the Asia Pacific Activities Conference (APAC), the Association of China and Mongolia International Schools (ACAMIS), the International Schools Athletic Conference, Beijing-Tianjin (ISAC), as well as participating in the China Cup and “Tri-Cities” tournaments with schools in Shanghai and Guangzhou  . Through these leagues, WAB athletes regularly travel to compete against other top international schools in China and across Asia. The program emphasizes sportsmanship, skill development, teamwork, and personal growth over pure competition . Committed, passionate athletes are supported, but beginners are equally welcome to learn new sports in a supportive environment . Thanks to this approach, WAB has produced student-athletes who continue their sport at the collegiate level – alumni have gone on to prestigious universities like NYU, McGill, and Brown on sports teams or scholarships .

The athletic facilities at WAB enable a high-quality sports program (detailed in the Campus section below). Moreover, WABX and the Parent Link “Tiger Spirit” committee ensure strong school spirit at games and events, and WAB often hosts tournaments. For instance, in spring 2025 WAB hosted the APAC Badminton tournament, coinciding with a vibrant community Night Market festival on campus , illustrating how athletics and community engagement go hand-in-hand at WAB.

Clubs and Activities: Outside of arts and sports, WAB offers a tremendous variety of clubs catering to academic enrichment, hobbies, leadership, and service. These are too numerous to list exhaustively – 300+ offerings run through WABX – but they include: student government, Model United Nations, debate, STEMx (science & engineering club) , coding and robotics clubs, entrepreneurship (the Tiger Den incubator supports student startups) , community service clubs and charity initiatives, environmental action groups, cooking and culture clubs, and many more. Even in elementary, age-appropriate after-school activities (ASAs) let younger children explore art, science, sports, and games in fun ways . WAB structures three seasons of ES activities so that children can try a variety of pursuits throughout the year . A signature ES event is the “Olympic Dream Series,” a year-long lunch-time athletics series for Grades 2–5 that encourages mass participation and team spirit in a range of mini-events .

Several unique clubs and student-led initiatives make WAB stand out among international schools in Beijing. The **Tiger Den incubator**, for instance, functions like a startup accelerator—students pitch real business ideas and receive mentorship from local entrepreneurs and parent professionals. The **WAB Podcast Club** produces regular episodes spotlighting community voices, exploring student perspectives on current events, and conducting interviews with faculty and alumni. The **Global Changemakers Club** partners with NGOs to work on United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, while the **Human Library Project** brings in community members to be “living books,” allowing students to hear diverse life stories and experiences firsthand. The **AI & Ethics Lab**, launched in 2025, invites students to explore emerging technologies through a lens of philosophy, law, and computer science—reflecting WAB’s leadership in integrating ethical innovation into its co-curriculars. These are just a few examples of how WAB empowers students to lead with creativity, responsibility, and global vision.

Through these co-curricular programs, WAB students develop leadership and teamwork. In fact, WAB students often initiate and lead new clubs or events – for example, in 2025 the student-run STEMx Club organized WAB’s first-ever inter-school Science Day, expanding a “simple idea into something much bigger” . Similarly, Middle School student council organized a school-wide “MS Got Talent” show to build confidence and community . These examples show WAB’s ethos of empowering student agency beyond the classroom.

Campus and Facilities

WAB is located on a spacious campus in Chaoyang District, Beijing, featuring world-class facilities that support its academic and co-curricular programs. The campus is often described as one of the most well-resourced in Asia . Key features of WAB’s campus include:
	•	Academic Buildings: The school is divided into Early Childhood Center (ECC), Elementary School (ES), Middle School (MS), and High School (HS) sections, each with purpose-designed learning spaces. Classrooms are modern, flexible, and technology-enabled. In 2018, WAB completed “The Hub,” a central collaborative learning space linking divisions, and renovated design labs as part of its innovative campus master plan (continuously evolving to meet future education needs). Each division has its own library, science labs, art and music studios, and breakout areas for collaborative work.
	•	Libraries: WAB boasts three main libraries – the Sabina Brady Library in ES, Red Scroll Library in MS, and Green Sky Library in HS. Collectively they house over 60,000 books in 15 languages, plus extensive digital resources . These libraries serve as vibrant centers for research, reading, and events (book fairs, author visits, etc.). Parents and community members are even invited to use the collections, reflecting WAB’s inclusive ethos .
	•	Arts & Performance Facilities: For a school of its size, WAB has exceptional arts venues. The campus includes two professional theaters – the Founders’ Theatre (often used for ES productions) and the Blu Theatre, as well as a more experimental black-box space called **“Out of the Box” Theatre  . These venues are equipped with full lighting and sound systems to support concerts and plays. There are dedicated visual arts studios, photo darkroom, and design technology workshops. Music students benefit from multiple practice rooms, ensemble rooms, and a recording studio. The “Visual and Performing Arts Wing” is a specialized complex housing many of these facilities together for interdisciplinary creativity  .
	•	Athletic Facilities: WAB’s sports infrastructure is state-of-the-art. The campus includes multiple indoor gymnasiums: an ES gym, MS gym, and HS gym, each sized for full-court games  . There is a dedicated Adrenalin Fitness Center (weight room and cardio gym) for students and staff  . WAB has a 25-meter indoor swimming pool for aquatics teams and lessons  . Outdoor facilities feature the large Tiger Field (a turf field for soccer, rugby, track, etc.) and a Tiger L’Air Dome – an inflatable dome that can cover Tiger Field in winter months  , ensuring year-round training. In addition, there is a secondary Dragon Field and multiple playgrounds for younger students  . Two rooftop tennis courts provide for tennis and other ball sports (and double as futsal courts). During Beijing’s cold winters, WAB even takes advantage of its picturesque Duck Lake on campus by creating an ice-skating rink for community skating .
	•	Outdoor and Recreational Spaces: The campus is green and inviting, with themed gardens and quiet areas. A classical Chinese Garden and a tranquil Lotus Lounge provide cultural touches and spaces for reflection  . Students enjoy multiple playgrounds, an ECC play yard, and the Peace Park for outdoor play and learning  . The campus is threaded with walking paths and features the iconic Xiangyin Bridge across the central pond (a popular spot for community events)  .
	•	Technology Infrastructure: As an Apple Distinguished School, WAB is heavily invested in educational technology . The entire campus has robust wireless connectivity and IT infrastructure to support a 1:1 device program. Students in Grades 1–5 use school-provided iPads (one-to-one in elementary) while Middle and High School students bring MacBook laptops as part of a BYOD program  . The school’s IT Department provides on-site support with an Apple-style “Genius Bar” helpdesk and certified Apple repair technicians on staff . Classrooms are equipped with interactive displays, and specialized labs have industry-standard software and hardware (e.g. for design, media production, science data logging, etc.). WAB actively explores emerging technologies; students engage with artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) tools as part of learning, guided by an ethical use policy  . In 2023–25, WAB introduced AI-as-a-tutor initiatives – allowing students to use AI for personalized feedback and extension, under teacher supervision – to further personalize learning . The seamless integration of tech is such that WAB’s IT environment supports everything from daily digital learning to large-scale virtual events.

Safety and Well-being: The campus has comprehensive security and health measures. All buildings have advanced air filtration systems (crucial in Beijing’s air pollution) to ensure safe indoor air quality  . WAB monitors air quality and has guidelines restricting outdoor activities on high pollution days . The school employs professional security at campus gates and maintains emergency preparedness plans. Additionally, WAB is a leader in child safeguarding policies, with clear protocols to ensure student well-being on campus.

Overall, WAB’s campus serves not only its students but also the wider community. After school hours and on weekends, WAB opens many facilities to students, parents, and staff for recreational use – families swim in the pool, use the fitness center, play tennis, etc., strengthening community bonds .

Student Body and Culture

WAB’s student body is truly international and diverse. Students hail from around 40–50 countries, with major representation from the expatriate communities of the United States, Canada, UK, Australia/New Zealand, Asia, and Europe, as well as host-country nationals (with foreign passports)  . (Per the High School profile, about 46% of HS students are from North America/UK/Aus-NZ, 39% from Asia, 14% from continental Europe, and 1% other regions .) This diversity is a point of pride: “WAB’s diversity is reflected with no one nationality exceeding 20% of the student body.”  The school celebrates cultural diversity through international festivals, language programs, and curriculum units that draw on the cultures of its students.

In 2024–25, total enrollment is about 1,400 students across all grades . Class sizes are kept moderate (often in the low 20s or less per class in elementary, and similarly reasonable sizes in secondary) to facilitate individualized attention. The overall student–faculty ratio is about 7:1 , ensuring small-group learning and strong relationships.

WAB students are known for being engaged, well-rounded, and community-minded. The school ethos “Connect, Inspire, Challenge: Make a Difference” is evident in student life . From a young age, WAB students engage in service projects (e.g. charity drives, environmental projects), Chinese cultural immersion activities, and leadership roles. Secondary students often mentor younger ones, and cross-divisional house events and spirit days build unity. School spirit is embodied in the mascot, the WAB Tiger, and students enthusiastically cheer on teams and celebrate each other’s achievements (the “Celebrating Our Students” news feed regularly highlights student accomplishments in academics, arts, and service ).

Student Support and Well-being: WAB fosters a supportive environment. Counselors in each division guide students’ social-emotional health and university counseling in high school is robust, with dedicated college counselors for the university admissions process . Learning support staff and EAL teachers ensure students with learning differences or English language needs are included and successful . In recent years, WAB has introduced innovative well-being initiatives – for instance, the “Yellow CAR” felt experience indicator (launched in 2025) to help students communicate their emotional state, and a focus on student-led conferences to give students voice in their learning journey .

During the COVID-19 pandemic, WAB’s community proved resilient. By 2024, life on campus returned to normalcy with the full resumption of activities, and students demonstrated adaptability and unity through the challenging years . The Class of 2024, for example, was lauded for its “resilience, engagement, and heart” in the face of disruptions . This characterizes WAB’s student culture – supportive, adaptive, and optimistic.

Faculty and Staff

WAB’s faculty is a highly qualified and internationally diverse group of educators. There are approximately 200 faculty members (teachers) across the school, drawn from dozens of countries. (In the High School alone, there are 58 teachers representing 17 nationalities .) Teachers are primarily recruited from top international schools and home-country systems worldwide, often bringing advanced degrees and significant teaching experience, especially in IB curricula. The IB programs require specialized training, and WAB invests in ongoing professional development – many teachers are IB workshop leaders or examiners themselves.

The faculty–student relationships at WAB are strong. With small classes and the school’s emphasis on community, teachers serve as mentors and coaches beyond the classroom – advising clubs, leading trips, and engaging with parents. Teacher innovation is encouraged; for instance, faculty lead the integration of new technologies and pedagogies, contributing to WAB’s “innovative school” reputation. In 2025, as part of the KingLead assessment, WAB’s faculty excellence and professional expertise were highlighted as a core strength of the school  .

WAB’s staff also includes specialists like educational technology integrators, counselors, learning support specialists, librarians, nurses, and a sizeable operations team (administration, admissions, facilities, etc.) that keeps the school running smoothly. The leadership team comprises experienced international educators: each division has a Principal (e.g. High School Principal Dr. Jaime Pustis) and Vice Principal, and there are directors for areas like Innovation in Learning & Teaching (to drive pedagogy and PD). This team, under the Head of School, collaborates closely with the Board on strategic initiatives.

WAB teachers and staff regularly earn recognition beyond the school. Teachers present at international conferences, and WAB is often visited by other schools’ educators as a model. The school’s I-DEAS initiative (Inclusion through Diversity, Equity, Anti-Racism, and Social Justice) involves staff working on DEIJ goals – demonstrating faculty commitment to continuous improvement in line with WAB’s values.

Leadership and Governance

WAB is governed by a Board of Trustees in accordance with Chinese regulations for international schools (WAB is licensed to educate foreign passport holders). The Board is all-volunteer and includes a mix of board-appointed and parent-elected members, ensuring both continuity and community representation . The Board’s primary role is long-term strategic governance – hiring and supporting the Head of School, setting broad policies, and safeguarding WAB’s mission and financial health  . Uniquely, WAB’s Board policy stipulates that no more than 50% of the Board can be of one nationality , mirroring the school’s diversity in its governance. The Board Chair for 2024-25 is Ms. Nathalie Azzopardi, and members include corporate, diplomatic, and parent representatives, as well as WAB’s Head of School (ex-officio) and a US Embassy representative who serves as a permanent guest (given the school’s historical ties to the expat community)  .

Operational leadership is headed by the Head of School, who as of 2025 is Dr. Marta Medved Krajnovic . Dr. Krajnovic and her team handle day-to-day management and instructional leadership. The Senior Leadership Team includes division principals (for ES, MS, HS), the Director of Innovation & Learning (a role focusing on curriculum development, currently Mr. Stephen Taylor) , and department heads. WAB’s leadership emphasizes collaborative decision-making – teachers and even students have input through committees and councils, and the Board works “in a spirit of partnership” with school leadership and staff representatives .

Legally, WAB is a not-for-profit school; any surplus is reinvested into the school’s programs and facilities. The governance model and the mission-driven approach contribute to stability – WAB has been able to maintain its values since its founding by a group of visionary parents in 1994 (some of whom still have a legacy presence in the community).

Community Engagement and Parent Involvement

WAB often describes itself as more than a school – it’s a community. Parents, alumni, and students are all actively involved in making WAB a vibrant place. Key aspects of community engagement include:
	•	Parent Link (Parent Association): All WAB parents and guardians are automatically members of Parent Link, the volunteer parent organization . Parent Link’s mission is “to make a difference by connecting, supporting and enriching our community in a spirit of shared enthusiasm and positive action.”  This group serves as a vital link between home and school. Parent Link volunteers organize numerous events and initiatives: for example, they host the big annual Fun Fair (a carnival day open to all families), a Winter Community Market, and other social gatherings . They run a school store selling WAB spirit wear and items (with proceeds often funding school projects) . They also coordinate Tiger Spirit Link (parent volunteers who support sports teams and arts performances with logistics and refreshments)  and Friends of the Library (parents helping with book fairs, library events, and reading programs) . Through Community Link, parents themselves get to explore Beijing together via cultural outings and activities in the city  – recognizing that settling into Beijing is a journey for expat families.
Parent Link acts as a voice for parents as well, meeting with school leadership regularly to share feedback and ideas . WAB’s administration values this partnership; it creates a welcoming atmosphere where parents feel part of the educational process. During teacher appreciation days, Parent Link organizes thanks for staff, and during the pandemic they were instrumental in community support efforts. The school frequently acknowledges that it “loves its parent community” – a sentiment evident in things like a Parent Link thank-you video to teachers that was shared widely in 2021 .
	•	Parents as Learners: WAB believes in educating the whole community. The school runs a “Parents as Learners” workshop series with sessions on topics like parenting skills, understanding the IB, college admissions, and mental health. These sessions are led by WAB staff or external experts and are very popular among parents . Recent topics have included “how we teach math at WAB,” “talking to teens about tough issues,” and “supporting your child’s high school journey” . This not only empowers parents to better support their children, but also strengthens the partnership between home and school.
	•	Community Use of Facilities: As noted, WAB opens its campus resources to families outside school hours. It’s common to see parents and staff using the pool for lap swimming, playing pickup basketball in the gym, or even skating on the frozen lake in winter with their kids . This community campus access fosters camaraderie and a sense of ownership among families (as well as promoting healthy lifestyles). There’s an online booking system for facilities and a Community Activities Office coordinating classes like adult fitness or language courses for interested parents.
	•	Alumni Network: With 30 years of history, WAB now has a growing alumni community around the globe. The school has an Alumni Office and runs alumni events in different cities. Alumni frequently return to campus (or Zoom in) to mentor current students, speak at assemblies, or offer internships to WAB seniors. WAB celebrated its 30th anniversary in September 2024 with two days of events that brought together “community members, both old and new,” including many alumni and former staff  . That celebration kicked off a whole year of activities strengthening connections across generations of WAB community members .
	•	Service and Local Engagement: WAB is deeply engaged with the local Beijing community and China at large. The China Engagement program ensures students learn about and interact with their host country. Through partnerships with local schools and charities, WAB students volunteer and initiate service projects (e.g. supporting migrant children’s education, environmental clean-ups, fundraising for local causes). The Charity Link arm of Parent Link also works with student clubs and external organizations to support charitable initiatives in Beijing and beyond . During events like the Night Market or International Day, WAB invites local vendors, artisans, and performers to participate, further integrating the school into the fabric of the city.

Overall, WAB’s community is characterized by a high level of parent involvement, cross-cultural collaboration, and a supportive network. Communication is strong – the school provides weekly e-newsletters, maintains active social media (in multiple languages), and even has a WAB Podcast featuring voices from the community . During the height of COVID, this sense of community was vital: parents and teachers worked hand in hand to facilitate virtual learning and then safe reopening, demonstrating the “spirit of shared enthusiasm and positive action” that Parent Link upholds .

Accreditations and Memberships

WAB meets the highest international standards for schools. Its key accreditations and affiliations include:
	•	International Baccalaureate (IB): WAB is authorized for the PYP, MYP, and DP programs and has been an IB World School since the 1990s . The IB’s philosophy permeates WAB’s curriculum and professional development.
	•	Council of International Schools (CIS): WAB is fully accredited by CIS, reflecting compliance with rigorous standards in curriculum, governance, and student support . CIS accreditation attests to WAB’s commitment to continual school improvement and global citizenship.
	•	New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC): WAB is accredited through NEASC (specifically through its Commission on International Education) . This provides an American accreditation quality stamp, including recognition of WAB’s high school diploma for U.S. college entry. WAB most recently underwent re-accreditation in the mid-2010s and is in good standing.
	•	Chinese Government Authorization: WAB is one of the licensed international schools for children of foreign nationals in Beijing (approved by the Ministry of Education). It was among the earliest such schools (license obtained in the 1990s) and continues to operate with full MOE authorization. (Note: As a foreign-affiliated school, WAB generally cannot enroll PRC nationals without foreign passports, in line with regulations .)
	•	Regional School Associations: WAB is a member of the East Asia Regional Council of Schools (EARCOS), connecting it with other international schools in East Asia for conferences and professional exchange . WAB is also active in the Association of China and Mongolia International Schools (ACAMIS), frequently hosting ACAMIS sports tournaments and cultural conventions  . Additionally, WAB belongs to the Educational Collaborative for International Schools (ECIS) – in fact, it serves as an ECIS Professional Learning Hub in Beijing, often hosting teacher workshops and events for the region (as evidenced by the dedicated “ECIS Hub” section on its website).
	•	Activities Conferences: In athletics and arts, WAB’s memberships have been noted: APAC (a selective consortium of Asia-Pacific international schools for sports and fine arts festivals) , ISAC (Beijing/Tianjin league) , etc. These memberships facilitate the rich co-curricular exchanges WAB is known for.
	•	Other Affiliations: WAB is a member of the College Board (allowing it to administer SATs, AP exams if needed for non-IB courses, etc.) and has a CEEB code for U.S. college applications . It is also an official test center for SAT/ACT and other exams. WAB has partnerships with educational organizations like KingLead (the Chinese education think-tank that ranked it #1 innovative school) and frequently collaborates with research groups (it was, for example, a pilot school for Project Zero initiatives out of Harvard in past years).

The combination of IB, CIS, and NEASC accreditation – and consistent commendations during those evaluations – speaks to WAB’s quality. Inspectors have praised WAB’s culture and programs; for instance, an accreditation report highlighted WAB’s “global leader in innovation of learning and teaching” status .

University Matriculation and Graduate Outcomes

WAB graduates are highly successful in gaining admission to top universities worldwide. The High School Profile (2024–25) summarizes that WAB students matriculate across North America, the UK/Europe, Asia, and beyond. The Class of 2024 (79 students) earned offers from and enrolled in an impressive array of institutions:
	•	United States & Canada: WAB alumni enroll at elite U.S. universities including multiple Ivies and Tier-1 schools. Recent classes have matriculated at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia (3 from the Class of 2024), Brown (2), Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, and other top privates like Duke, Emory, Carnegie Mellon; prestigious liberal arts colleges (e.g. Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore in earlier years; Mount Holyoke (4) from the Class of 2024)  ; and leading public universities (such as UC Berkeley, UCLA, University of Michigan – WAB being a California ELC eligible school for UC admissions). Canadian destinations often include University of Toronto (17 offers to Class of 2024) , UBC (11 offers) , McGill, McMaster, University of Waterloo, etc. Many students choose U.S. schools – typically around 40-50% of the class – while a significant number opt for Canadian universities (about 10–15% in recent classes) .
	•	United Kingdom: The UK is another popular destination (roughly 10–15% of grads). WAB graduates have gone on to Oxford and Cambridge (the Class of 2024 had an Oxford admit and a Cambridge admit) , as well as prestigious London universities like Imperial College (3), King’s College (4), University College London (2)  . Niche schools such as Royal College of Music and Arts University Bournemouth also appear, reflecting some students pursuing specialized arts. The Russell Group universities (e.g. Edinburgh, Bath, Manchester, Warwick) are frequent choices  .
	•	Asia & Oceania: A growing number of graduates choose universities in Asia. In recent years students have matriculated at top Hong Kong universities (HKU, CUHK, HKUST) , prestigious Korean institutions like Seoul National University (7 from Class of 2024) and Yonsei  , and elite universities in mainland China for those eligible (e.g. Peking University, Tsinghua via special programs, or NYU Shanghai)  . WAB’s bilingual and bicultural students are well-prepared for these environments. Additionally, WAB grads attend universities in Japan (Keio, ICU, Waseda in past years) , Singapore (NUS), and other countries. In Australia/New Zealand, popular choices include University of Melbourne, ANU, University of Sydney, University of Auckland, etc.  .
	•	Europe (Continental): Some students each year attend universities in Europe outside the UK, especially those from European families. Destinations have included Erasmus University Rotterdam, University of Amsterdam (5), Leiden University College, Lund University (Sweden), and various universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, etc.  . Specialized programs in Europe (e.g. ETH Zurich or hospitality schools in Switzerland) have also attracted WAB grads historically, fitting particular interests.

WAB’s College Counseling office provides individualized guidance, and the results show in both the range and quality of admissions offers. Typically, virtually all WAB graduates who apply to university secure placement – many at their top-choice institutions. Furthermore, the breadth of fields they pursue is notable: WAB grads go into STEM, business, arts, humanities – reflecting the school’s encouragement of following one’s passion.

In terms of standardized testing (though IB is the main credential), WAB students historically score well above U.S. averages on SAT/ACT when needed, and the average IB scores (as noted, 33 at WAB vs ~30 worldwide) give them a competitive edge in international admissions. Universities often remark on WAB students’ creativity, global mindedness, and strong extracurricular profiles, which are cultivated by the school environment.

Alumni Outcomes: Beyond university, WAB alumni have embarked on successful careers worldwide. Many remain connected through the alumni network, and some return to WAB as teachers, staff, or board members, contributing back to the community that shaped them. The values of WAB – resilience, innovation, compassion – are evident in its graduates, who truly become “responsible global citizens” as envisioned by the school’s mission. A testament to WAB’s reputation is that employers and universities recognize the school; for example, WAB was highlighted in the KingLead rankings not just for innovation but also for its “community and global influence”, indicating the esteem of its outcomes in broader society  .

Partnerships and Recent Developments (2024–2025)

Swiss School Beijing: One of WAB’s distinctive partnerships is with the Swiss School Beijing (SSB). Established in 2017 as a collaboration between WAB and the Association Swiss School Beijing, the SSB is the first Swiss government-recognized school in China . It operates as a German-language section within WAB, offering a Swiss curriculum program for native German (and French) speaking children. Initially opened with Kindergarten and Grades 1–2, the Swiss School has added grades each year; by 2024–25 it expanded up to Grade 9 , with plans to eventually cover through Grade 12. Students in SSB are integrated into WAB’s campus and wider community (sharing arts, sports, and many events) while receiving instruction in German following Swiss standards  . This unique program allows WAB to serve Beijing’s Swiss and German-speaking expat families. It exemplifies WAB’s innovative spirit and commitment to multilingual education – as WAB’s director at the time said, “making education accessible in many languages to serve our community.”  The partnership has been very successful, with the Swiss School’s students learning in their native language “situated uniquely within WAB’s innovative and diverse learning community.”  (Notably, SSB students also take classes in English and can join WAB’s Chinese program to ensure they are multilingual .) This WAB-SSB model has been highlighted as a win-win in international education circles.

Innovative School Recognition: In March 2025, WAB was once again honored by KingLead as China’s Most Innovative International School, marking the fifth consecutive year of this recognition . The KingLead ranking evaluated 1,200 schools on criteria such as international accreditation, faculty excellence, global influence, and expert assessments . WAB’s top placement underscores its cutting-edge practices in learning (from AI integration to student agency programs) and serves as positive reinforcement for its 2022+ Strategic Plan which emphasizes innovation. WAB’s Head of School Dr. Krajnovic noted that this “fifth consecutive [innovation] award is…a motivation to carry on the work we deeply believe in.”  The news was widely shared in the community and is a point of pride – current and prospective families see it as confirmation that WAB prepares students not just for today but for the future.

China Schools Awards 2025: As mentioned earlier, WAB won the 2025 China Schools Award for Arts & Creativity (awarded by the British Chamber of Commerce) . This was announced at a ceremony in Beijing in March 2025, where WAB was the winner among all international and bilingual schools in China in the Arts/Creativity category. Such an award recognizes whole-school excellence in arts education – from curriculum to co-curricular offerings and community engagement in the arts. Additionally, WAB was a finalist in other categories such as Diversity & Inclusion (reflecting its I-DEAS work) and Science & Technology, further evidencing its well-rounded strength. These accolades enhance WAB’s profile and validate its strategic focus areas (the WAB Strategy 2022+ explicitly targets excellence in inclusion, innovation, and sustainability).

30th Anniversary and Community Projects: The 2024–25 school year has been special as WAB celebrates 30 years since its founding in 1994. On September 1–2, 2024, the school hosted a massive 30th Anniversary Celebration with two days of events – inviting alumni from around the world, past and present staff, students, and parents for reunions, performances, and ceremonies  . It was an “unforgettable” festival of WAB’s history and ethos. The anniversary theme “Tigers Roar Into the Future” not only celebrated the past but also launched new projects looking ahead  . Throughout 2024–25, WAB organized a “30 Years, 30 Stories” campaign highlighting inspiring stories from the community, planted a jubilee time capsule, and initiated a scholarship fund for the children of front-line medical workers in Beijing (as a legacy of lessons learned during COVID). The anniversary also saw the introduction of the Founders’ Award, a new annual award to honor a student or staff member exemplifying WAB’s core values, named in honor of the school’s founders.

Educational Initiatives: WAB remains a laboratory for new ideas in education. In late 2024, WAB piloted the use of Toddle (an IB-focused learning platform) in Middle School, which provides streamlined curriculum management and even has built-in AI support. By June 2025, students and school leadership were enthusiastic about how “Toddle’s learning flexibility, AI support & new functions” enhanced reflection and feedback in the MYP . WAB also hosted #FOEN25 (Future of Education Now 2025), a conference that brought together educators from across Asia to discuss progressive education trends – fittingly held on WAB’s campus in April 2025 as part of its thought leadership role. This conference showcased WAB’s programs (attendees visited classrooms) and strengthened WAB’s ties with the global educational community.

Another project launched in 2024 was the “Tiger Den” entrepreneurship incubator (an extracurricular program) which has already supported student startups in areas from sustainable products to educational apps . The first cohort of Tiger Den teams pitched their projects in May 2025, with mentorship from parent entrepreneurs, underlining how WAB leverages its community’s strengths to enrich student opportunities.

Infrastructure and Sustainability: Facility-wise, WAB continues to upgrade. In 2024 the school completed a refurbishment of its Middle School science labs (celebrated with a MS Science Showcase event in May 2025) . Solar panels were installed on the rooftops of two buildings as part of WAB’s sustainability commitment – by 2025, some 15% of campus energy is now generated via solar, with plans to increase that. The cafeteria menus have also shifted to include more plant-based options, and a campus composting system was introduced in early 2025, all aligning with WAB’s goal to model sustainable practices (a pillar in the WAB Strategy 2022+).

Finally, WAB’s community engagement stood out in early 2025 when it opened its gates to host a citywide charity run in collaboration with other international schools, raising funds for a local children’s hospital. Over 5,000 attendees came to WAB for the event, which featured student performances, food stalls (run by WAB Parent Link and student groups), and the race itself . This event not only raised substantial funds but also showcased “everything that makes WAB special to 5,000+ attendees from across Beijing”  – a true celebration of community spirit and WAB’s leadership in bringing people together.
